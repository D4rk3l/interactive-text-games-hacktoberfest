# Hacktoberfest 2020 Interactive Text Games
A place to submit your own (or edit other peoples') interactive text games in any language!

You can submit whatever you want as long as it's some kind of interactive text game (it needs to have user inputs).
Feel free to edit and add on to other people's code too! However, please make meaningful changes instead of just copy-pasting code. Laziness /=/ learning.

## How to Contribute


### Step 1: Fork the repository

Click the "Fork" icon in the top right to fork the repository.



### Step 2: Upload/edit your text adventure game

#### FOR ADDING YOUR OWN GAME, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:

Once the repository is forked, place your text adventure game inside it and format the file name like this:

`text-adventure-game/text-adventure-game.py` 

Putting the "text-adventure-game/" in front of the name [creates a folder](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/29f2fd0f075716239c61d9cd7dd58c5b02ca297a/687474703a2f2f692e737461636b2e696d6775722e636f6d2f3949666d6a2e676966) for it.
Of course, this is just an example. Name it what you want, as long as it matches the format above. It also doesn't have to be python - use any language you want!


#### FOR EDITING SOMEBODY ELSE'S GAME, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:

Open the folder of whichever text game you'd like to edit.

Copy and paste the game inside so that there are two copies of them and add the version number at the end of the one you're editing:

`other-game-v2.py`

If you're editing a version that has already been edited, add the sub-version number of that version to the end:

`other-game-v2-2.py`

This ensures that the original author's work is preserved, and your copy is separate.

Once you've edited or added what you want, move on to the next step.



### Step 3: Commit your changes and submit a pull request

Please explain what you want to add in the pull request title, like so:

`"Add text-adventure-game"`

or

`"Add other-game-v2"`

### You're done! I will verify your pull request as soon as possible, and then it should show up on the Hacktoberfest 2020 website.
